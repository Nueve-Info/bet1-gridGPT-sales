      question: "How is GridGPT different from other sales intelligence tools?",
      answer:
        "Sales intelligence tools primarily provide data (contacts, firmographics, signals). GridGPT focuses on the next step: turning that context into outbound-ready execution—structured insights, angles, and message drafts you can reuse across sequences, without losing consistency or quality.",
    },
    {
      question: "What data sources does GridGPT use?",
      answer:
        "GridGPT can work with the data you already have (CRM fields, lead lists, enrichment outputs) and commonly used public/company signals (e.g., website, LinkedIn-level company info, job posts, news/announcements). The idea is simple: pull relevant context into one place so it’s usable for outreach.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I integrate GridGPT with my CRM?",
      answer:
        "Yes! GridGPT is designed to fit into existing workflows. You can typically connect or sync via standard CRM exports/imports and common automation tools (e.g., Zapier/Make), so lead context and notes can flow between GridGPT and your CRM with minimal friction.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does GridGPT help with outbound?",
      answer:
        "It shortens the path from “lead list” to “send.” GridGPT organizes key insights in one place and helps you craft strong first lines, angles, and follow-ups based on real context.",
